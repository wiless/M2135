Software Implementation of IMT.EVAL Channel Model
1	Introduction
IMT-Advanced channel models were agreed in the 3rd ITU-R Working Party 5D meeting in Seoul, Korea in October 2008, and confirmed in ITU-R Study Group 5 meeting in Geneva in November 2008. The channel models were published in Report ITU-R M.2135 [1]. Reference implementation of channel models was contributed to the 3rd ITU-R WP 5D meeting as well [2].
However, the implementation is updated according to the recent findings and interpretation of the Report ITU-R M.2135.
This contribution covers an updated reference implementation of the current version of Report ITU-R M.2135 radio channel model. The implementation has been developed for convenience and it runs on Matlab® environment, and is available as attachment. The implementation is modified from [2].
To make it easier to use the IMT-Advanced channel models by the external parties, public implementation of the channel models is helpful. Therefore, the attached Matlab software implementation of the channel models is provided to ITU-R for publishing at the ITU-R IMT-Advanced submission and evaluation process web page for easy reference.
2	Software package
Attached file contains the current version of the Matlab® functions and documentation for the IMT-Advanced channel model in Report ITU-R M.2135. The functions and documents have been packed by WinZip® program. The material may be updated by the author in future. Please contact the author to confirm whether there is any update of the material.
